##Introduction

Buying a car is one of the most expensive decisions a family can make.

One way to help with this cost is to buy a used car.  Another way would be to use any free cash to invest in the stock market.

This paper will try to investigate the possibility of investing cash in the stock market in order to save for the future purchase of a car.

## Question

Suppose a man has $2000 to use to purchase a car, and wants a late model vehicle.  The current price for a new vehicle of the type he wants is $20,000.  If he buys it used, the price will decrease by 20%, 15%, and then 10% per year after the third year.  Unfortunately, he will not be able to know whether he will be able to get a good used car in the first or second year.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

How much memory does it take to store numbers in gammma notation?
```{r}
a = 1:512
b = 2 * 10^a
plot (a, b)
plot (a, floor(log2(b)))
c = log2(b - log2(b))
plot (a, c)
cbind(a, ceiling(log2(a)))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

##How much memory does it take to store numbers in gammma notation?

It takes a linear amount of space to store each number in unary notation.  When numbers get big, the amount of space needed to store them goes up with the size of each number.
```{r}
a = 1:512
b = 2 * 10^a
```
```{r}
plot (a, b)
```

With binary notation, the amount of space required to store each number is proportional to the log of the size of each number.
```{r}
plot (a, floor(log2(b)))
```
```{r}
c = log2(b - log2(b))
plot (a, c)
cbind(a, ceiling(log2(a)))
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

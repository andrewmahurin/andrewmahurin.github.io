space shuttle weight at launch	http://coolcosmos.ipac.caltech.edu/ask/268-How-much-did-the-Space-Shuttle-weigh-. The space shuttle weighs 4.4 million pounds at launch, but only has 65,000 pounds of useful cargo capacity. 4.4 million pounds converts to 22000 tons, and 65,000 pounds converts to 32.5 tons of cargo. 32.5 tons of cargo converts to about one-half a load on one train car. This seems like too little compared to all of the fuel involved.	2015-08-06T13:00:08-0400
train horizontal guide wheel	https://books.google.com/books?id=aThfAAAAcAAJ&pg=PA309&lpg=PA309&dq=train+horizontal+guide+wheel&source=bl&ots=yk55hFj6DT&sig=JudnTHLV1cfgQyCc-fg_bB_1eVM&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CEkQ6AEwC2oVChMI8JqKit6WxwIVhSUeCh0OBQ76#v=onepage&q=train%20horizontal%20guide%20wheel&f=false; The book indicates that the width of railroad tracks was a problem when they were first being built. They forced the wheels to be smaller, in order to lower the center of gravity. It also mentions the horizontal guide wheel as being a method to prevent derailing. The invention was new back then, so it never took off.	2015-08-07T12:30:53-0400
	The flanged wheel continued to be developed, and continued to be dominant. The plan for the horizontal guide wheel seemed too complicated for what was able to be manufactured back then. The flanged wheel thus became the standard way of manufacturing trains, running on narrow tracks. The tracks tended to run through the countryside, and even up mountains, so that it was important that they be narrow, so that less land had to be made level, such as when going around mountains or even through them.	2015-08-07T12:37:13-0400

airplane fuel usage year	http://www.transportenvironment.org/sites/te/files/media/2005-12_nlr_aviation_fuel_efficiency.pdf. Aircraft seem to getting more fuel efficient at a rate of about 3% per year. The author believes there to be some minimum amount of fuel reuired to be used to fly a plane, but he does not know what that minimum is.	2015-08-07T12:44:47-0400
takeoff fuel	http://www.worldwatch.org/planes-utilize-most-fuel-during-takeoff. Planes use 205 million tons of fuel each year. About 25% of that is used during takeoff. Other websites show that this amount of fuel can be reduced. I think that completely elliminating takeoff fuel usage could eliminate 40 million tons of fuel usage each year. It would also reduce the amount of fuel that the plane needs to carry to get to its destination. This would also reduce the size of the plane necessary to get the plane to its destination. If only half of the takeoff fuel were reduced, then this would still be around 20 million pounds of fuel being saved each year. I think this would be worth it for building the support structure such as a catapult or rail guideway to make this happen.	2015-08-07T13:03:12-0400

high speed train rolling resistance	http://www.istc.illinois.edu/about/SeminarPresentations/20091118.pdf. Trains hae a low level of rolling resistance, at the level of .001, compared to .006 to .010 for truck tires. The problem is when trains start to accelerate to higher speeds. At these speeds, air friction becomes more important. They give a formula for the amount of force needed to propel the train forward at different speeds. The formula is F = A + BV + CV2, with CV2 beig a quadratic term. A is constant and just related to the train's weight. BV is linearly related to the train's velocity, and CV^2 is quadraticly related to the train's velocity. As the train accelerates, the amount of rolling friction in relation to a train's weight matters less. As the train accellerates, air friction in relation to the train's speed matters more, because it is increasing quadraticly. On second glance the formula is R = AW + BV + CV^2. This relates resistance to the three main variables. Another website uses Ff to represent the force of friction, and applies it to all vehicles.	2015-08-07T16:20:05-0400
diesel locomotive engine horsepower	The largest train locomotive is over 10,000. This is large enough to push an airplane to takeoff if the plane is the right size. There is the problem of the plane possibly tipping over or being affected by lift on one wing but not the other. The problem of the plane possibly tipping over will be solved by using a wider track. At some point, though, the plane would be too wide for a practical train track to be built for it. This would especcially be the case if the train track was also meant for general use, as most of them are. A wide train track would allow for small and medium size airplanes to takeoff from it if they were pulled to sufficient speeds. The problem would be when the airplane would reach a bend in the railroad, and it might still tople.	2015-08-08T05:40:44-0400
...	A more powerful train track pulling the plane would be able to shorten the time until the airplane lifts off of the ground, so that the train track can be wider for a short distance, if only to accomidate the widest of airplanes.	2015-08-08T05:44:03-0400
